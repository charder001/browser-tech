## Assignment 1.2

### iPod Touch

IOS 6.1.6. Safari 8536.25
Background is slow
Crashes after a few seconds

### Nexus 5

Android 6.0.1
Chrome 75
Slow performer but it works fully

### Apple iPad MF432NF/A iOS9.3.5

Safari 9.0
Search function does not work (fetch)
Everything else seems to work

### Screen reader
When using the website with windows built in screen reader, it becomes evident that the website is not optimized for such accessibility tools. Images don't have alt text, links don't have names. Tab navigation doesn't work either.

### Fix
Images need alt text, links need to have meaningful names. Navigation with tabs should be possible by making the HTML more semantic.

## Introducion to ShirtMaker

This app allows the user to create custom shirts by changing colors and adding text. The app has been designed to feature different layers of usability, functional - useable and pleasureable. I interpreted this as, the core functionality has to work with pure HTML, the usability comes from adding styling and flair with CSS and the pleasureability comes from enhancement using client side JavaScript.

### Use Case
ShirtMaker is an application designed for the use case: I want to be able to design, print and save nerdy t-shirts and be able to pick up where i left off after i leave the site.

### Sketches
Sketches where the user can edit colors, text, save and print their shirt.
